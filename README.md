            <h2>INTRODUCTION:</h2>
            <p>India is the world's third-largest producer and third-largest consumer of electricity. The national electric grid in India has an installed capacity of 370.106 GW as of 31 March 2020. Renewable power plants, which also include large hydroelectric plants, constitute 35.86% of India's total installed capacity. India has a surplus power generation capacity but lacks adequate distribution infrastructure.</p>
            <p>In this project, we are going to analyze Daily power Generation in India and get to understand the trends and generation of power across multiple regions in India for a spectrum of 4 years vis 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020. The dataset contains 6917 rows and 10 columns.</p>
            <p>We have downloaded the data from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/navinmundhra/daily-power-generation-in-india-20172020">Kaggle</a> and are grateful to Mr. Navin Mundhra for uploading the data.</p>
